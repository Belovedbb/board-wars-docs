Board Wars is a tool which provides Agile based methodologies as a medium of project management, it is highly reactive, uses cloud native patterns for high availability and features  complete API spec for an application development.   It is developed with micro-service architecture in mind thereby facilitating loosely coupled services interacting with themselves.
  
There are many great Project Management tools available, this is just an attempt to produce something fast and cloud native centric while still not losing the benefit of the functionality.
